Write a TUI to manage a medical office, and specifically the list of reservations.

For a reservation we are interested in the name of the patient, the scheduled time, the type of visit and the
cost. From the discussion with the expert domain we understood that the patient can be represented by
strings of letters, numbers and spaces; the length of such strings doesn’t exceed 100 chars. The same
restrictions apply to the type of visit. The scheduled time must be shown in hours and minutes (eg. 15:20 for
20 minutes past 15); choose the internal representation. The cost must be represented in euro, with two
decimal digits (and definitely it’s not a negative number).

The application must allow to
●show all reservations, always sorted by ascending scheduled time
●add and remove reservations
●restrict the visualization to reservations scheduled after a given time

Data must be saved automatically on disc in a file default.csv in the root of the project and loaded when the
application starts. We expect tests, too… should I still say it?!?
