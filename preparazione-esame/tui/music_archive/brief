Write a TUI to manage a music archive, and specifically the list of songs.

For a song we are interested in the author, the title, the genre and the duration. From the discussion with the expert
domain we understood that the author can be represented by strings of letters, numbers and spaces; the length of
such strings doesn’t exceed 100 chars. The same restrictions apply to titles and genres. The duration must be
shown in minutes and seconds (eg. 3:25 for 3 minutes and 25 seconds); choose the internal representation.

The application must allow to
    ● show all songs
    ● add and remove songs
    ● show the list of authors
    ● restrict the visualization to the songs of a given author
    ● sort songs according to several criteria (of your choice)

Data must be saved automatically on disc in a file default.csv in the root of the project and loaded when the
application starts. We expect tests, too… should I still say it?!?
